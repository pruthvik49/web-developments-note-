Beginner Friendly Web Development Notes (HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL)

This repository contains all the notes and study material I created while learning web development online. I made these notes in a simple and easy-to-understand language for complete beginners, so anyone who is just starting their web development journey can use them too.

Inside this repo, you’ll find:

HTML – Basic structure of a webpage, important tags, forms, tables, semantic elements, etc.

CSS – Styling basics, selectors, layout (Flexbox / Grid), colors, fonts, and simple examples.

JavaScript – Simple examples to start with scripting ✨ (you can use JavaScript if you want to build dynamic client-side logic).

PHP – Server-side scripting basics, syntax, form handling, GET & POST methods (you can also choose PHP if you want to work on back-end or connect to a database).

MySQL – Basics of databases, creating tables, simple queries, and how to connect it with PHP or JavaScript (Node.js).

These notes are easy to follow, beginner friendly and written in a step-by-step format. You can either use PHP or JavaScript depending on what type of project you want to build — both options are covered in a simple way.

I’ll keep updating this repository as I learn more. Feel free to use these notes for your own learning, revision or to kickstart your web dev journey.
